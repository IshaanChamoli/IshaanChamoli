<h1>👀 Hey! My name is Ishaan.</h1>
<hr>
I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign...<br><br>

I'm really excited about the future of technology, especially the role that startups (and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL1MOOD5Ox8"> anti-startups</a>!) will play in shaping it. As part of that future, I can't wait to build for the developing world - to change education and the economy as we know it.<br>

<i>“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”</i><br>
I once spent an hour pacing up and down my room, memorizing that entire speech by Steve Jobs. It's so cool!

<ul>
  <li>ML + Deep Learning</li>
