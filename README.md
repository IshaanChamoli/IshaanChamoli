<h1>👀 Hey! My name is Ishaan.</h1>

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

<i>“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”</i>
I once spent an hour pacing up and down my room, memorizing that entire speech by Steve Jobs. It's so cool!

I'm really excited about the future of technology, especially the role that startups (and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL1MOOD5Ox8"> anti-startups!</a>) will play in shaping it. Personally, I can't wait to use tech and build for the developing world.




<i>I believe the next wave of technological disruption is going to be led by startups and a few really innovative team is going to take place in rapidly developing countries (like India!), creating a world that's currently unimaginable, in which I hope to play an important role.</i>
